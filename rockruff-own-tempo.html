        <p>Rockruff is a Rock-type Pok√©mon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves into Lycanroc at level 25, which can further evolve into either Midday Form or Midnight Form depending on the time of day.
            Rockruff is known for its loyalty and playful nature. It has a keen sense of smell and is often seen accompanying trainers on their journeys. Its unique ability, Own Tempo, prevents it from becoming confused, making it a reliable companion in battles.</p>
